# Codex Agent Instructions

This repository is a Rust project that simulates electrochemical particle systems.

## Programmatic Checks
- Run `cargo check` before committing changes to verify the project compiles.
- The `cargo test` suite relies on features that do not function in the Codex environment, so it is unnecessary to run `cargo test` here.

## Module Guides
Each major module under `src/` has its own `AGENT.md` file describing the module and key files.
