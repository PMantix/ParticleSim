# Archived Documentation

This folder contains historical implementation documentation that was created during development but is no longer needed in the main project directory.

## Structure

### `implementation-fixes/`
Contains documentation for completed bug fixes and implementation improvements:
- **IMPLEMENTATION_FIXES.md** - Screen capture implementation fixes and improvements
- **TEMPERATURE_UNIT_FIXES.md** - Temperature unit corrections and fixes
- **THERMAL_FORCE_BALANCE_FIXES.md** - Thermal vs electrostatic force balance fixes
- **SCREEN_CAPTURE.md** - Screen capture feature implementation details

### `features/`
Contains documentation for completed features and optimizations:
- **PLOTTING_FEATURES.md** - Plotting and visualization feature implementations
- **PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION.md** - Performance improvements and optimizations
- **REALISTIC_Z_FORCES.md** - Out-of-plane (Z-direction) physics implementation

## Purpose

These documents were moved here to:
1. Keep the main project directory clean and focused on current development
2. Preserve historical implementation details for reference
3. Maintain a record of completed work and decisions made during development

## Status

All features and fixes documented in these files have been completed and integrated into the main codebase. These documents are kept for historical reference only.
