# Domain size (full width/height of the simulation domain)
# Optimized configuration balancing electrode geometry, particle density, and GUI viewing:
# - Electrodes closer together (±100 Å vs ±150 Å) and taller/thinner
# - Particle counts reduced 0.35× while preserving species ratios
# - Results in 25% liquid packing fraction and 8% of realistic density
