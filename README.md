## Features

### Core Physics
- **Barnes-Hut Quadtree**: Efficient spatial partitioning for O(N log N) force calculations
- **Parallel Simulation**: Rayon-based multi-threading across available CPU cores
- **Explicit Electron Dynamics**:
  - Lithium metal particles include explicit valence electrons that drift and hop
  - Electrons polarize in response to local electric fields
  - Butler-Volmer kinetics for inter-species electron transfer
- **Accurate Redox Transitions**: Li⁺/Li species transitions with strict charge conservation
- **Polar Solvents**: EC and DMC with bound electrons and polarization forces
- **Optional 2.5D Out-of-Plane**: Particles can temporarily move vertically to bypass 2D crowding

### Electrochemical Control
- **Switch-Charging System** (NEW):
  - 4-step cyclic switching between foil pairs for symmetric charging
  - **Global or per-step setpoints**: Configure once or customize each step
  - **Current mode**: Direct electron injection (e/fs) with sign polarity
  - **Overpotential mode**: PID voltage control with complementary targets (V and 2−V)
  - JSON import/export for configuration sharing
  - Real-time step monitoring and configuration validation
- **Foil Electrodes**:
  - Configurable structures that apply electric currents
  - Group linking (parallel or opposite modes)
  - Real-time current and overpotential monitoring

### Collision Dynamics
- **Soft Collision System** (NEW):
  - Per-species toggles for collision softness (default: Li⁺ only)
  - Anion soft collisions configurable independently
  - Softness factor scales correction forces (0.0 = hard, 1.0 = very soft)

### Visualization & Analysis
- **Advanced Field Visualization** (ENHANCED):
  - **Isoline controls**: Count, fidelity, adaptive refinement near crossings
  - **Percentile clipping**: Dynamic range with bias and margin adjustments
  - **Filled isobands**: Translucent bands between levels
  - **Nonlinear distribution**: Gamma warp for perceptual level spacing
  - **Color mapping**: Strength and gamma controls for contrast
- **Measurement Tool** (NEW):
  - Directional projection mode: Define an axis for aligned measurements
  - History recording with switch-charging metadata
  - CSV export with simulation context
- **Real-time Data Plotting**:
  - Time series plots (species populations, currents, hop rates)
  - Spatial profile plots (charge, velocity, field distributions)
  - Full domain binning regardless of particle locations
  - Export in CSV, JSON, or TSV formats
- **Interactive GUI**:

  - Particle selection with detailed diagnostics
  - Screen capture with customizable regions
  - Playback controls with history scrubbing

#### Measurements & CSV Logging (Updated)
- Point-based CSV: records only the leading-edge position per measurement point. One row per timestep: `frame,time_fs,<label1>_edge,<label2>_edge,...`. Auto-named as `Point-based_*` under `doe_results/`.
- Foil-based CSV: one row per timestep with grouped columns for each foil (ordered by foil ID): `mode_f<ID>`, `setpoint_f<ID>`, `actual_ratio_f<ID>`, `delta_electrons_f<ID>`, `li_metal_count_f<ID>`. “Actual ratio” matches the foil electron ratio from the charging tab. Field toggles in the Measurements UI control which groups are populated.
- Time-based CSV: domain-wide solvation fractions (CIP, SIP, S2IP, FD) plus charging context (mode and setpoint/current). Auto-named as `Time-based_*` under `doe_results/`.
- All three CSV toggles live in the Measurements section and default to enabled. Filenames auto-name consistently and can be overridden in the UI.

### Workflow & Configuration
- **State Management**: Save/load simulation states for reproducible experiments
- **Scenario Presets**: Quick setup with pre-configured arrangements
- **Configurable Physics**: Runtime adjustment of LJ parameters, hopping rates, Butler-Volmer coefficients
- **Domain Control**: Adjustable bounds, timestep, force cutoffs

## Units

Lengths are measured in angstroms (Å), time in femtoseconds (fs), charge in
elementary charge (e) and mass in atomic mass units (amu). See
[docs/physics.md](docs/physics.md) for the complete unit system and conversion
guidelines.

## Development & Debugging

- **Manual Stepping**: Use the GUI step button for frame-by-frame analysis
- **Particle Selection**: Click particles to view detailed diagnostics in console
- **State Management**: Save/load simulation states for reproducible experiments
- **Playback History**: Scrub through the recorded history buffer, adjust replay speed, and seamlessly resume live simulation. Save files now include frame, time, and thermostat metadata while remaining backward compatible.
- **Configurable Physics**: Modify parameters in real-time through the GUI
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Run the test suite with `cargo test`
- **Performance Profiling**: Enable with `cargo run --features profiling`
- **Thermostat Debug (Optional)**: Enable detailed thermostat logging (scales, per-frame temperature diagnostics) with `--features thermostat_debug`.

### Temperature Definitions
The simulation distinguishes between:
- **Liquid Temperature**: Computed over LithiumIon, ElectrolyteAnion, EC, and DMC particles (center-of-mass drift removed). This represents the thermal state of the mobile electrolyte phase.
- **Global Temperature**: Computed over all dynamic bodies (excluding constrained metals’ bulk drift via COM subtraction). Useful for detecting runaway energy in non-thermostatted components.

Only liquid species (Li⁺, anion, EC, DMC) are rescaled by the Maxwell–Boltzmann thermostat. Metals (LithiumMetal, FoilMetal) are excluded to preserve electrode dynamics. During bootstrap (very low initial KE) all liquid species are assigned randomized velocities to seed a Maxwellian distribution.
